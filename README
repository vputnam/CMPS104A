PARTNER



This program was completed using pair programming.



Partner: Rashmi Sehgal (rasehgal@ucsc.edu)

Partner: Vanessa Putnam (vputnam@ucsc.edu)



We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should

drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and

at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should

be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer

must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work

together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into

two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.





Rashmi Sehgal spent 2 hours working alone.

Vanessa Putnam spent 2 hours working alone.



We spent 6 hours working together.



Vanessa Putnam spent 3 hours driving.

Rashmi Sehgal spent 3 hours driving.
